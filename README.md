# Netlify Extension

This extension is created using the [Netlify SDK](https://sdk.netlify.com/get-started/introduction/). It is a boilerplate for creating a new extension.

**You can install this extension in your Netlify account by clicking [here](https://app.netlify.com/extensions/leqfnf6m-showcase).**

## Scripts

These are some common scripts you will use when developing your extension. If you want to know what else is possible, [check out the documentation](https://sdk.netlify.com/netlify-sdk-utility-tools-reference/).

### Build

This builds the extension into a `.ntli` folder. This is the folder that Netlify uses to run the extension.

```bash
npm run build
```


### Deploy
